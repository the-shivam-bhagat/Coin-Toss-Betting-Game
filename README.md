# ðŸŽ² Coin Toss Betting Game

## Project Title
Coin Toss Betting Game â€“ No-Input Smart Contract

## Project Description
A decentralized coin toss game built in Solidity (v0.8.17) that deploys without any constructor inputs. Players bet on Heads or Tails and can win double their stake minus a house edge.

## Project Vision
Provide a frictionless deployment experience for developers and users by eliminating the need for manual parameter entry at deployment time.

## Key Features
- **No-Input Deployment**: Default `minimumBet` (0.01 CORE) and `houseEdge` (5%) set internally.  
- **Secure Betting**: Bet outcomes logged on-chain with pseudo-random results.  
- **Owner Controls**: Functions to fund and withdraw contract balance.  
- **Game History**: Comprehensive record of each bet, result, and timestamp.

## Future Scope
- Integrate Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness.  
- Add frontend DApp interface for seamless user interaction.  
- Implement leaderboards and NFT-based rewards.
